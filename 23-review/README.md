REVIEW
------
* General Comment:
	* Remove the temp files (those that end in ~)

* Abstract Class Thing:
	* What exactly is the difference between "rx", "ry" and "x" and "y"?
	It is not specified in the code (line 7)
	* Also, what is t? (line 7)

* Class Character:
	* Not a bug, but is hp and velocity the only attributes?

* Class Hero:
	* Empty~~

* Class Enviro:
	* Why the second constructor? If all other stuff specify if they're movable/breakable, doesn't that make the code more readable? 

* Class Trashcan:
	* I don't quite understand the logistics of "breakable." Do they still have hp or is the thing just broken in 1 hit?

* Class Item:
	* Sill confused about itemNum, what exactly is it?
	* If it's the id of the item, why not make it a string?
